# Practice SysAdmin Bootcamp DevOps

Small project to provision 2 machines automatically using Ansible as provisioner tool, one with ELK stack and another one with Wordpress and Apache. The wordpress machine 
will also install filebeat so it collect the logs and send them to ELK machine so they can be visualized in kibana GUI

## Hardware settings for the virtual machines used

 - Virtual Machine 1(Ansible)
     - Ubuntu Bionic 18.04
     - RAM : 1GB
     - CPU : 2
     - IP	: 192.168.33.13
     - Network : Keepcoding
  
- Virtual Machine 2(Wordpress)
    - Ubuntu Bionic 18.04
    - RAM	: 1GB
    - CPU	: 2
    - IP	: 192.168.33.11
    - Network	: Keepcoding
    
- Virtual Machine 3(Elastik)
    - Ubuntu Bionic 18.04
    - RAM	: 4GB
    - CPU	: 2
    - IP	: 192.168.33.12
    - Network	: Keepcoding

## Installation üîß

Open a terminal and navigate to the project root folder, then start the 3 virtual machines by executing: 
```shell
vagrant up
``` 
Once the 3 machines are up and running login into ansible machine by executing:
```shell
vagrant ssh ansible
```
Then just launch the ELK playbook to install all required tools in the elastik machine by executing:
```shell
ansible-playbook -b /vagrant/ELK-playbook/site.yml 
```
We then do the same to provision wordpress machine with all the required tools by running:
```shell
ansible-playbook -b /vagrant/wordpress-playbook/site.yml
```

Once all the tasks has finished succesfully. Open your browser and enter ```localhost:8081/blog``` to go to wordpress installation page, and enter your configuration details then press install wordpress button at the bottom.

After that open another tab in the browser and enter ```localhost:5601``` to get to Kibana GUI, on the top left corner click on the hamburguer icon and then click on **stack management** then click on **index patterns->create pattern**, add the logstash-filebeat index, and press enter, the add the **@timestamp** to in the time field and click on create index pattern.

Click on the hamburguer icon again and then go to **Kibana-> Discover** so you can see all the logs receive from the wordpress machine (in order to do this you need to have at least have installed wordpress as told in the previous steps)
